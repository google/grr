"""This file contains a helper class for the flows.

This flow context class provides all the methods for handling flows (i.e.,
calling clients, changing state, ...).

Each flow must have a flow runner before it can be executed. The flow runner is
responsible for queuing messages and maintaining scheduling state (e.g. request
IDs, outstanding requests, quotas etc),

Runners form a tree structure: A top level runner has no parent, but child
runners have a parent. For example, when a flow calls CallFlow(), the runner
creates a new flow (with a child runner) and passes execution to the new
flow. The child flow's runner queues messages on its parent's message
queues. The top level flow runner ends up with all the messages for all its
children in its queues, and then flushes them all at once to the data
stores. The goal is to prevent child flows from sending messages to the data
store before their parent's messages since this will create a race condition
(for example a child's client requests may be answered before the parent). We
also need to ensure that client messages for child flows do not get queued until
the child flow itself has finished running and is pickled into the data store.

The following is a summary of the CallFlow() sequence:

1. The top level flow runner has no parent_runner.

2. The flow calls self.CallFlow() which is delegated to the flow's runner's
   CallFlow() method.

3. The flow runner calls StartFlow(). This creates a child flow and a new flow
   runner. The new runner has as a parent the top level flow.

4. The child flow calls CallClient() which schedules some messages for the
   client. Since its runner has a parent runner, the messages are queued on the
   parent runner's message queues.

5. The child flow completes execution of its Start() method, and its state gets
   pickled and stored in the data store.

6. Execution returns to the parent flow, which may also complete, and serialize
   its state to the data store.

7. At this point the top level flow runner contains in its message queues all
   messages from all child flows. It then syncs all its queues to the data store
   at the same time. This guarantees that client messages from child flows are
   scheduled after the child flow itself is serialized into the data store.


To manage the flow queues, we have a QueueManager object. The Queue manager
abstracts the accesses to the queue by maintaining internal queues of outgoing
messages and providing methods for retrieving requests and responses from the
queues. Each flow runner has a queue manager which is uses to manage the flow's
queues. Child flow runners all share their parent's queue manager.
