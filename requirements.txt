# This is the main requirements.txt file that includes all python dependencies
# for the entire project. There are also client requirements files that are
# maintained independently to minimise the installs required to build the
# respective clients:
#
# - client/windows/requirements.txt
# - client/linux/requirements.txt (also used for OS X)
#
# Ideally *this* file would just contain server dependencies and use '-r' to
# import client dependencies. This is impossible since the same dependency
# cannot be listed more than once:
# https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/56
#
# and we have multiple packages that are required in both the server and the
# client. So until pip can handle proper dependency resolution we'll maintain
# these separately. Please check if the client files need to be updated if you
# update this one.
