# Breaking Changes

## Upcoming version

* The server YAML configuration options path_globs_blacklist and
  path_globs_whitelist in get_flow_files_archive of router_params of
  ApiCallRobotRouter have been renamed to exclude_path_globs and
  include_only_path_globs.
* The server YAML configuration option Artifacts.netgroup_user_blacklist has
  been renamed to Artifacts.netgroup_ignore_users.
* The server YAML configuration options labels_whitelist and
  labels_owners_whitelist in router_params of ApiLabelsRestrictedCallRouter
  have been renamed to allow_labels and allow_labels_owners.
* The server YAML configuration option artifacts_whitelist of
  artifact_collector_flow of router_params of ApiCallRobotRouter has been
  renamed to allow_artifacts.
* The `ExecutePythonHack` flow returns a `ExecutePythonHackResponse` message
  rather than raw string object as a response.
* ApiHunt.hunt_type was introduced and should be used instead of
  a now-deprecated ApiHunt.name.
* Variable hunts now have their arguments filled in the ApiHunt.flow_args
  attribute.
* JSON representation of `st_ino`, `st_dev`, `st_nlink`, `st_blocks`,
  `st_blksize`, `st_rdev` fields of `StatEntry` now use strings rather than
  integers. This is a consequence of increasing the supported integer size of
  these values which might be out of bounds for JSON numbers.
* The `st_crtime` field of `StatEntry` has been renamed to `st_btime`.
* ArtifactCollectorFlowArgs, ArtifactFilesDownloaderFlowArgs:
  * use_tsk is replaced with use_raw_filesystem_access
  * use_tsk is kept for compatibilty until 2021-04-01
    * please migrate away from use_tsk to use_raw_filesystem_access until then
  * ValueError is raised if both fields are set
* WinUserActivityInvestigationargs:
  * This message is obsolete, removing it.
* ClientArtifactCollectorArgs
  * Removing use_tsk, since it hasn't been used on the client side
