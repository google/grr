# This directory is reserved for external artifacts

The Makefile removes `*.yaml` from this directory when syncing the external repo
located [here](https://github.com/ForensicArtifacts/artifacts).

## Where artifacts go

-   Private artifacts should go in `artifacts/local`.
-   Public artifacts that are non GRR specific should be submitted to the
    external repo.
-   Public artifacts that call GRR functions with `LIST_FILES`,
    `GRR_CLIENT_ACTION` etc. should live in `artifacts/flow_templates`.
