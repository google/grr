// The nanny is an external process which controls the execution of a child
// process. If the child crashes, or exits unexpectedly, the nanny will restart
// the child. If the child becomes unresponsive, the nanny will kill the child.
// The ChildController class implements the policy about when the child should
// be started and killed. Unresponsive children are killed after the
// unresponsive_kill_period and restarted after the resurrection_period.

// For example, this is the time line:

// | Child started     | Child killed             | Child started.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------->
// |<----------------->|  unresponsive_kill_period
//                     |<------------------------>| resurrection_period

// The ChildProcess class encapsulates operating system specific control of the
// child process (i.e. methods for killing and restarting the process).
