"""This file defines the base classes for Flows.

A Flow is a state machine which executes actions on the
client. Messages are transmitted between the flow object and the
client with their responses introduced into a state handler within the
flow.

The flow can send messages to a client, or launch other child flows. While these
messages are processed, the flow can be suspended indefinitely into the data
store. When replies arrive from the client, or a child flow, the flow is woken
up and the responses are sent to one of the flow state methods.

In order for the flow to be suspended and restored, its state is
stored in a protobuf. Rather than storing the entire flow, the
preserved state is well defined and can be found in the flow's "state"
attribute. Note that this means that any parameters assigned to the
flow object itself are not preserved across state executions - only
parameters specifically stored in the state are preserved.

In order to actually run the flow, a FlowRunner is used. The flow runner is
responsible for queuing messages to clients, launching child flows etc. The
runner stores internal flow management information inside the flow's state, in a
variable called "context". This context should only be used by the runner itself
and not manipulated by the flow.

The flow state is a normal dict (even though only types supported by
the ProtoDict class are supported in the state):

self.state.parameter_name = parameter_name

The following defaults parameters exist in the flow's state:

self.args: The flow's protocol buffer args - an instance of
  self.args_type. If the flow was instantiated using keywords only, a new
  instance of the args is created.

self.context: The flow runner's context.

self.runner_args: The flow runners args. This is an instance of
  FlowRunnerArgs() which may be build from keyword args.
