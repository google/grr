# Frontend

## Development server
First make sure `grr_admin_ui` is up and running.

Run `ng serve` (or `ng s`) for a dev server. Navigate to
`http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` (or `ng t`) to execute the unit tests. The test will automatically
reload if you change any of the source files.
