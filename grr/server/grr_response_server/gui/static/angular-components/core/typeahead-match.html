<!--
  Custom autocompletion list item template:

  Removed highlighting, since highlighting uses the whole input text, but we suggest autocompletions
  based on parts. Also, this reduces the attack surface because HTML binding is no loner required.

  Removed title, since ng-attr-title was not evaluated properly and showed literally
  {{match.label}} in tooltips.
-->
<a href tabindex="-1" ng-bind="match.label"></a>
