// Binary data object.
//
// Blobs are used mostly (but not exclusively) to represent contents of files:
// sending an entire file in one Protocol Buffers message is not feasible, so we
// divide files to smaller portions and deliver it to the server one by one.
//
// On the server, the blob sink stores blobs immediately in a blobstore instead
// of storing it in the database to be later picked up by a worker for further
// processing.

  // Binary data that the blob represents.

  // TODO: Consider adding compression.
  //
  // When transferring blobs, GRR offers optional compression layer. This is not
  // that important since messages sent by Fleetspeak are compressed anyway, but
  // may reduce amount of communication to and from Fleetspeak.
