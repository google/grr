# A more recent version of distribute is required for matplotlib (to be
# installed in the next step) on vanilla precise. So you will need to uncomment
# this for testing. However, travis has upgraded their version of
# setuptools so this isn't required. And running it actually breaks travis. It
# seems to trigger this bug which was supposedly fixed as of pip 6.1.0:

# sudo -H pip install distribute --upgrade
