      problem: Legacy services are running.
      fix: |
        This system has legacy services enabled that are insecure and should
        not be running. In some cases, there may be more suitable replacements
        for these services.

        If a similar service is needed, use a secure replacement.  Otherwise,
        services should simply be disabled.

        Disable services that provide remote administration facilities.

          - restricted to trusted hosts and networks.
          - strongly authenticated.
