# Use this file to specify what clients should be built with what labels using
# python grr/client/client_build.py buildanddeploy

# Build all these contexts. If multiple contexts are listed separated by ','
# they will be applied sequentially for that build run.
ClientBuilder.BuildTargets:
  - AllPlatforms Context
#  - SomeLabel Context
#  - AllPlatforms Context,SomeOtherLabel Context

AllPlatforms Context:
  ClientBuilder.target_platforms:
    - darwin_amd64_dmg
    - linux_amd64_deb
    - linux_i386_deb
    - linux_amd64_rpm
    - linux_i386_rpm
    - windows_amd64_exe
    - windows_i386_exe

# For example this tells buildanddeploy that it needs to build deb and rpm
# installers for 64-bit linux with the "somelabel" baked in.
#SomeLabel Context:
#  Client.labels: [somelabel]
#  ClientBuilder.target_platforms:
#    - linux_amd64_deb
#    - linux_amd64_rpm

# This label will be built for all platforms since the AllPlatforms context is
# applied above.
#SomeOtherLabel Context:
#  Client.labels: [someotherlabel]
